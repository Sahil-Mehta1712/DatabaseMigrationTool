# DatabaseMigrationTool

The tool aims to streamline the process of migrating database table structures from one database system to another. It focuses on extracting metadata, such as table information, column names, data types, constraints, and indexes, from a source database and then automatically generating SQL scripts that can recreate these tables in a target database.

Key Features:

1. Metadata Extraction: The tool connects to the source database using database-specific APIs or libraries (e.g. MSSQL, Oracle etc). It retrieves metadata information about tables, columns, data types, constraints, and indexes.
2. Script Generation: Based on the extracted metadata, the tool dynamically generates SQL scripts for creating tables in the target database. It ensures that the scripts follow the syntax and formatting requirements of the target database system.
3. Handling Changes: The tool includes logic to handle differences in SQL syntax and table creation conventions between source and target databases. For example:
   i. It maps data types from the source database to equivalent data types in the target database.
   ii. It adjusts syntax for constraints (e.g., primary keys, foreign keys) and indexes to match the requirements of the target database system.
  iii. It accommodates differences in naming conventions or reserved keywords between databases.
4. Customization Options: Users can configure the tool to include or exclude specific elements during script generation, such as constraints, indexes, or default values. Customization options allow users to tailor the output scripts according to their migration requirements.
5. Scalability: Users can provide connection property data and add new databases thus allowing this tool to be scalable

Workflow Example:

1. User provides connection details for both the source and target databases.
2. The tool connects to the source database and extracts metadata for selected tables.
3. Based on user preferences and customization settings, the tool generates SQL scripts for table creation in the target database.
4. The generated scripts undergo a review process to ensure accuracy and compatibility with the target database system.
5. Users execute the scripts in the target database environment to recreate tables with corresponding structures.

   
Benefits:

1. Time-Saving: Automates the tedious task of manually writing table creation scripts, saving time and effort in database migration projects.
2. Accuracy: Reduces the risk of human errors associated with manual script writing, ensuring that table structures are replicated accurately in the target database.
3. Flexibility: Adapts to differences in SQL syntax and conventions between different database systems, making it suitable for diverse migration scenarios.
4. Scalability: The ability to add new databases by providing minimal data for connection and syntax purposes

   
Overall, this Python tool simplifies and accelerates the process of migrating database tables while maintaining script integrity and compatibility across different database platforms.
